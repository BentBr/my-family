/**
 * Compute SVG-ready positions and edge coordinates for the family tree.
 *
 * Strategy (v3.1):
 *   1. Build child-of-person AND parent-of-person adjacency from
 *      parent_edges. Track biological parents separately so a step-link
 *      doesn't pull a child under the wrong couple inside a multi-couple
 *      block. Compute the depth of every person top-down from parentless
 *      anchors, equalize partners + propagate upward to a fixed point,
 *      invert to a "gen" index (top row == max gen), and promote eldest
 *      orphans by birth-year gap.
 *   2. Build per-row blocks: each same-row partner-edge connected
 *      component becomes one block (singleton, couple, or N≥3 chain).
 *   3. Choose a canonical parent block for each non-top block (the block
 *      containing the smallest-id parent of the block's anchor member).
 *   4. Place top-row blocks left-to-right with CLUSTER_GAP between them.
 *      Recursively lay out each top block's subtree, with multi-couple
 *      blocks splitting their children into per-couple sub-clusters.
 *   5. Sweep each row for inter-cluster collisions and enforce COL_GAP
 *      within a cluster, CLUSTER_GAP between clusters belonging to
 *      different parent blocks. Uses each block's `pixelWidth` so widened
 *      multi-couple blocks still get correct separation.
 *   6. Materialize positioned persons by reading each block's per-member
 *      x offset. Emit parent + partner edges from those coordinates.

/**
 * Bottom-up parent-over-children recentering. For each parent block,
 * recompute the children's midpoint from their CURRENT positions (post
 * row-separation) and shift the block so it sits centred above that
 * midpoint.
 *
 *   - NON-root blocks: midpoint comes from the direct block-tree
 *     children (`childrenOfBlock`). Matches the initial-placement
 *     centering rule in `layoutSubtree`.
 *   - ROOT blocks: midpoint comes from the direct PARENT-EDGE children
 *     (`childrenOfPerson` from each block member). The block tree
 *     misses one parent of a multi-couple chain (the "second mother"
 *     case — a chain [son_a, anchor, son_b] is owned by son_a's
 *     mother only, son_b's mother sees no block-tree descendants), so
 *     a root with no block-tree descendant but a real parent_edge
 *     descendant ends up marooned at the far edge of the row. Using
 *     parent-edge children pulls each parent over to sit above their
 *     own child, and similarly pulls a far-off root cluster (e.g. an
 *     in-laws couple whose daughter married into the main tree) close
 *     to its real connection point instead of being banished to an
 *     arbitrary `cursor + CLUSTER_GAP` slot.
 *
 * Returns `true` when at least one block was shifted by > 0.5 px so the
 * caller can decide whether to re-run row separation + iterate. The
 * sub-px deadband keeps a successful recenter from being re-detected as
 * "still drifting" forever due to floating-point round-trips.
 *
 * Only the parent block itself moves — NOT its descendants. The next
 * row-separation pass picks up any collisions the parent shift created
 * in its own row.
