//! Owner-transfer repository.
//!
//! Phase E - two-token ownership handoff. A family may have at most one
//! pending transfer at any time (enforced by the partial unique index on
//! `family_owner_transfers`). The state machine is:
//!
//! - `begin` -> row inserted with both token hashes, both `*_confirmed_at`
//!   NULL, `expires_at = now + 1h`, `completed_at` / `cancelled_at` NULL.
//! - `confirm` -> looks up the row by either token hash and sets the
//!   matching side's `*_confirmed_at`. Returns the row + which side was
//!   confirmed.
//! - `complete` -> writes `completed_at`; called by the API after the role
//!   swap commits.
//! - `cancel` -> writes `cancelled_at`; owner-only.
//! - `find_active` -> read the current pending transfer (if any).
