// Auto-logout regression: after the access cookie's TTL elapses, the FE
// must use the surviving refresh cookie to mint a fresh session instead
// of bouncing the user to /auth/sign-in. The bug Bent saw in prod
// (logged out after "some min") is exactly this — refresh wasn't
// kicking in.
//
// We can't reliably wait out the 15-minute access TTL in an e2e, so we
// simulate the same browser-side state by removing JUST the access
// cookie from the context after sign-in. From the FE's perspective
// that's indistinguishable from "the browser dropped the expired
// access cookie": no access cookie attached to outgoing requests, the
// refresh cookie still present on /auth/refresh requests (it has its
// own longer TTL + narrower path).
//
// If `authRefresh` middleware works, the next API call gets a 401,
// triggers POST /auth/refresh, retries the original request, and the
// user stays on /account with the page rendered. If the refresh path
// is broken, the call surfaces 401 → endSession → redirect to
// /auth/sign-in (the symptom in prod).
