/**
 * Group a block's children by which internal couple produced them.
 * Three-tier match:
 *
 *   1. BOTH of the couple's members appear in the child's bio parents
 *      (canonical case: both biological parents listed).
 *   2. EITHER of the couple's members appears (graceful single-parent
 *      match — covers the very common case where a real family tree
 *      records only one parent_link per child, especially for in-
 *      married couples whose spouse the user hasn't added to the
 *      tree yet).
 *   3. Neither — fall back to the RIGHTMOST couple so step-only links
 *      or partnership-less children still sit visually under the
 *      current relationship.
 *
 * The two-pass shape (both, then either) matters because a multi-
 * couple chain's couples often share an anchor member. Without pass 1
 * the EITHER match would attach every chain-anchor's child to the
 * first couple in the chain (anchor sits in BOTH couples — false
 * positive). Pass 1 first claims children with full both-parent
 * matches; pass 2 only sees children left over after that.
 *
 * Worked example for a chain [husband_l, anchor, husband_r] where
 * `anchor` has husband_l as an ENDED partner and husband_r as an
 * OPEN partner (couples = [husband_l+anchor (ended), anchor+husband_r
 * (open)]):
 *   - Child with parents [husband_l, anchor] → couple 0 (pass 1).
 *   - Child with parents [anchor, husband_r] → couple 1 (pass 1).
 *   - Child with parents [husband_l] only → couple 0 (pass 2:
 *     husband_l appears in couple 0, NOT in couple 1).
 *   - Child with parents [anchor] only → couple 0 (pass 2: anchor
 *     appears in couple 0 first, then in couple 1). Visually
 *     grouping an anchor-only child with the older partnership is
 *     the saner default than placing her under the most recent one.
 *   - Child with parents [step-aunt] → couple 1 via rightmost
 *     fallback (no overlap with the chain).
 *
 * The child's bio parents are unioned across ALL members of the child
 * block, not just `block.members[0]`. A child whose own block is a
 * couple `[spouse, blood-child]` has `members[0] === spouse` whenever
 * the married-in spouse has the smaller id; that spouse has no bio
 * parents in this family, so keying off `members[0]` alone would drop
 * the child to the rightmost-couple fallback and strand it in the
 * wrong sub-cluster (the bug where an in-married sibling rendered
 * under the wrong partnership). Unioning across members surfaces the
 * blood child's parents regardless of intra-couple id order.

 *      left-to-right by birth date.
 *   2. Lay out each sub-cluster in isolation (cursor starts at 0) so we

 *      single-node-wide placeholder so the block still grows enough to fit
 *      two cards plus their gap.
 *   4. Derive each couple's target midpoint from its sub-cluster midpoint
 *      and convert into per-member offsets. Couples share an anchor member
 *      (the previous couple's right is the next couple's left), so we
 *      solve sequentially:
 *        first couple → symmetric around its midpoint with default
 *                        NODE_W + COL_GAP gap.
 *        subsequent   → left is the previous couple's right (already set);
 *                        right is whatever the equation requires, floored
 *                        at left + NODE_W + COL_GAP.
 *   5. Normalise to non-negative offsets, place each sub-cluster under its
 *      couple midpoint, set the block at `cursor.x`.
